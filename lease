## 1. ABSTRACT

The Lease Management System is a Salesforce-based solution designed to automate property lease operations. This system manages properties, tenants, lease agreements, and payments through a centralized digital platform. Key features include automated email notifications, approval workflows, trigger-based validations, and scheduled reminders. The project demonstrates practical implementation of Salesforce development tools including custom objects, Lightning apps, Apex programming, and Flow automation to streamline lease management processes and reduce manual effort by approximately 70%.
